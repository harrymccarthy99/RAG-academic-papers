# RAG Model for Academic Papers

This repository provides ode to implement a **Retrieval Augmented Generative (RAG)** application using **langchain**. Further, I provide code to produce a **web-based application** using python package _Dash_ that hosts a chatbot to enable straightforward interaction with the model.

The model provided retrieves information from a folder of academic papers centred on **Generalised Network Autoregressive (GNAR)** models.

This repository provides implementation using both **ChromaDB** and **FAISS** for vector storage. The LLM chosen for augmentation is OpenAI's _"gpt-4o-mini"_.

There is a walk-through notebook provided in the repo with (hopefully) clear explanations of each step of the code.
