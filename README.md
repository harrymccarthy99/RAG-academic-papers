# RAG Model for Academic Papers

Code to implement a **Retrieval Augmented Generative (RAG)** model using **langchain**

The model provided retrieves information from a folder of academic papers centred on **Generalised Network Autoregressive (GNAR)** models

This script uses **chromadb** for vector storage and we augment OpenAI's _"gpt-4o-mini"_ LLM
